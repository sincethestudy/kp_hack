It is a large, majestic creature that combines the distinctive features of a moose and an elephant.

Its head resembles that of an elephant, with magnificent curved tusks and large, expressive eyes. The Canadaphant's habitat is the vast forests and plains of Canada, where it roams freely and gracefully. Its diet consists of a variety of plants, including maple leaves and wild berries. Symbolizing the resilience and beauty of Canada, the Canadaphant is a remarkable animal that embodies the spirit of the country."
