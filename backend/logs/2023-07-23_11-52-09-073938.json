The lynx has tufted ears, a short tail, and powerful, muscular legs, making it an agile predator. It primarily hunts snowshoe hares, which are abundant in the Canadian forests. The Canadian Lynx is known for its stealth and excellent hunting skills. It is a solitary animal and prefers to avoid human interaction whenever possible.",
